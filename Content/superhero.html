His father, Jor-El, discovered that a nuclear chain reaction was building inside Krypton that would soon shatter the entire world so he took his son, put him in a starcraft and launched the starcraft toward Earth just before Krypton exploded. </p>

			<p>Daredevil's identity in the real world is Matt Murdock, a lawyer living in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in New York. When he was younger, he was blinded by a radioactive substance that fell from an oncoming vehicle, and even though he lost his sight, his other four senses were heightened to a superhuman level.</p>

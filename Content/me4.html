			<p>Speedy was just a normal kid watching his mosted beloved show when it started to rain. The rain started off small but grow more and more intense until the point were it knocked out the power. So he went outside to see what the problem was. The rain was coming down so hard now that he could hardly see his hands.  He found a latter and got on the roof. He got the satelite disk and was about to put it back when he got hit by lighting.
			When he woke up he has super powers! </p>

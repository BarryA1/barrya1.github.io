<h2><i>About ME</i></h2>
<div class="alll">
<h3 id="one"><p>Hello my name is Barry Allen and I'm a 10th grader at Madison Park T.V.H.S. were I'm learning how to use computers to program and create web pages from scrach. What I would like to learn more about in the future is about creating websites that people can google to get to. When I'm done with high school I want to work as somekind of a manager were I get to use what I learned in school to work on conputers. I believe that I would make a good employee because I learn really fast and if there is something I don't know how to do I am open to learning new things. Also I never step out of line.</p></h3>
